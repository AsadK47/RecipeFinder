- Lazy loading of recipe lists
- Computed properties with efficient filtering
- Debounced search to reduce computation

**Memory Management**
- @StateObject for managers (single instance)

- Persistent store coordinator pooling

### Architecture

**MVVM Pattern**
```
Views/ (SwiftUI Views)
  ‚Üì
Models/ (Data structures)
  ‚Üì
Persistence/ (Core Data managers)
```

**Key Components**
- `RecipeModel` - Core recipe data structure
- `ShoppingListManager` - Observable shopping list state
- `KitchenInventoryManager` - Kitchen tracking
- `PersistenceController` - Core Data singleton
- `RecipeShareUtility` - Export functionality
- `AppTheme` - Theming and colors
- `HapticManager` - Feedback singleton

**Data Flow**
1. User interaction in View
2. State change via @State or @Binding
3. Manager updates (@Published)
4. View re-renders automatically
5. Persistence to Core Data
6. Haptic feedback confirms action

### PDF Generation Algorithm

**Phase 1: Measurement**
```swift
1. Calculate content heights
   - Title: 150pt base
   - Info cards: 90pt + 24pt spacing
   - Ingredients: 24pt per item
   - Instructions: 60pt per step
   - Notes: 100pt estimated
2. Add padding and margins
3. Generate dynamic page height
```

**Phase 2: Drawing**
```swift
1. Draw full gradient background
2. Draw title (centered, 28pt, white)
3. Draw info cards (glass morphism)
4. For each section:
   - Draw white header (20pt bold)
   - Draw glass card background
   - Draw content with proper offsets
   - Advance Y position
5. Draw footer (centered, 11pt)
```

**Glass Card Rendering**
```swift
1. Create rounded rectangle path (16pt corners)
2. Fill with white @ 0.9 alpha
3. Stroke border: white @ 0.3 alpha, 0.5pt
4. Apply shadow: offset (0,4), blur 8, black @ 0.1 alpha
```

### Unit Conversion System

**Measurement Categories**
- Weight: kg ‚Üî lb, g ‚Üî oz
- Volume: L ‚Üî qt, ml ‚Üî fl oz, cups ‚Üî ml
- Temperature: ¬∞C ‚Üî ¬∞F
- Length: cm ‚Üî inches

**Conversion Flow**
1. Parse ingredient quantity and unit
2. Determine measurement type
3. Apply conversion factor
4. Format with locale-appropriate decimals
5. Append converted unit symbol

### Recipe Import Parser

**Schema.org JSON-LD Parsing**
```swift
1. Fetch HTML from URL
2. Extract <script type="application/ld+json">
3. Parse JSON with multiple fallbacks:
   - Single recipe object
   - Array of recipes (take first)
   - @graph wrapper format
4. Map fields:
   - name ‚Üí recipe name
   - recipeIngredient ‚Üí ingredients
   - recipeInstructions ‚Üí steps
   - prepTime/cookTime ‚Üí durations
   - recipeCategory ‚Üí category
   - recipeDifficulty ‚Üí difficulty
5. Handle missing fields gracefully
6. Create RecipeModel instance
7. Save to Core Data
```

### Haptic Feedback Strategy

**Light Haptics**
- Button taps
- Toggle switches
- Filter selections

**Medium Haptics**
- Clear all actions
- Delete operations
- Important state changes

**Success Haptics**
- Recipe import complete
- Shopping list finished
- Favorite added

**Selection Haptics**
- Tab switches
- Segmented control changes
- Menu item selections

### Color System

**Purple Theme**
```swift
Start:  RGB(131, 58, 180) - Deep purple
Middle: RGB(88, 86, 214) - Royal blue
End:    RGB(64, 224, 208) - Turquoise
Accent: Purple derivative
```

**Teal Theme**
```swift
Start:  RGB(20, 184, 166) - Teal
Middle: RGB(59, 130, 246) - Sky blue
End:    RGB(96, 165, 250) - Light blue
Accent: Teal derivative
```

**Gradient Locations**
- 0.0 (top) ‚Üí Start color
- 0.5 (middle) ‚Üí Middle color
- 1.0 (bottom) ‚Üí End color

**Dark Mode Adaptations**
- Ultra thin material for blur effects
- Higher opacity whites for contrast
- Deeper shadows for depth
- Adjusted secondary text colors

### Search Algorithm

**Multi-field Search**
```swift
1. Check recipe name (primary)
2. Check category (secondary)
3. Check ingredients (tertiary)
4. Combine results with OR logic
5. Sort by relevance:
   - Exact matches first
   - Prefix matches second
   - Contains matches last
6. Return filtered array
```

**Filter Combination Logic**
- Favorites: AND filter (must be favorite)
- Categories: OR filter (match any category)
- Difficulty: OR filter (match any difficulty)
- Cook time: OR filter (‚â§ any time limit)
- Search text: AND filter (must match)

### Core Data Schema

**RecipeModel Entity**
```
- id: UUID
- name: String
- category: String
- difficulty: String
- prepTime: String
- cookingTime: String
- baseServings: Int16
- notes: String
- isFavorite: Bool
- ingredients: [Ingredient] (Transformable)
- prePrepInstructions: [String] (Transformable)
- instructions: [String] (Transformable)
- timestamp: Date
```

**ShoppingListItem Entity**
```
- id: UUID
- name: String
- quantity: Int16
- category: String
- isChecked: Bool
- timestamp: Date
```

### Typography System

**Font Sizes**
- Title: 34pt (heavy weight)
- Large Title: 28pt (bold)
- Title 2: 20pt (bold)
- Headline: 17pt (semibold)
- Body: 14pt (regular)
- Caption: 13pt (semibold for values)
- Small Caption: 11pt (medium)
- Tiny: 10pt (medium for labels)

**Font Weights**
- Heavy: Title text
- Bold: Headers, important text
- Semibold: Values, emphasized text
- Medium: Labels, secondary text
- Regular: Body copy

### Animation System

**Spring Animations**
```swift
response: 0.3 (fast, snappy)
dampingFraction: 0.6-0.8 (slight bounce)
```

**Use Cases**
- Filter toggle: Spring 0.3
- View transitions: Spring 0.3
- Card tap: Light haptic + spring
- List item check: Spring 0.3 + haptic
- Confetti trigger: Success haptic + animation

**Transition Types**
- Move (top/bottom/leading/trailing)
- Opacity (fade in/out)
- Scale (grow/shrink)
- Slide (push/pop)
- Combined (move + opacity)

### Error Handling

**Recipe Import**
```swift
1. Validate URL format
2. Check network connectivity
3. Handle HTTP errors (404, 500)
4. Parse with fallbacks
5. Validate required fields
6. Show user-friendly errors
7. Log technical details for debugging
```

**Data Persistence**
```swift
1. Try save operation
2. Catch NSError
3. Rollback context if needed
4. Present alert to user
5. Log error for debugging
```

**Graceful Degradation**
- Missing recipe image ‚Üí Placeholder icon
- Import failure ‚Üí Clear error message
- No recipes ‚Üí Empty state with guidance
- No internet ‚Üí Offline notice (for import only)
