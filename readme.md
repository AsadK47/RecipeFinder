2. **Add AnimatedHeartButton.swift to Xcode target**
   - Open Xcode → Right-click Components folder → Add Files
   - Select AnimatedHeartButton.swift → Check "RecipeFinder" target
   - Build to verify

3. **Verify build passes**
   ```bash
   # YOU RUN THIS after fixes:
   xcodebuild -scheme RecipeFinder -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro' build 2>&1 | grep -E "error:|warning:" | head -20
   ```
